Enabling logging in your Spring WebFlux application can be done by configuring the logging levels for specific packages or classes in your application. Spring Boot provides various logging frameworks, including Logback and Log4j2, which you can configure to control the verbosity and output of logs. Here's how you can enable logging in your WebFlux application:

1. **Application Properties**:
   In your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, you can configure the logging levels for different packages or classes. For example, to set the log level to `DEBUG` for all packages, you can use:
   
   ```properties
   logging.level.root=DEBUG
   ```

   To set the log level for a specific package or class, use:
   
   ```properties
   logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
   ```

   Adjust the package name to target the specific area you're interested in.

2. **Console Output**:
   By default, Spring Boot logs to the console. Depending on your chosen logging framework, you'll see log messages of varying levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR) printed to the console. This can help you understand the flow of your application and identify issues.

3. **External Log Configuration**:
   For more advanced logging configuration, you can create a log configuration file (e.g., `logback.xml` for Logback) in your resources directory. This allows you to customize log formatting, log rotation, and more. Consult the documentation of your chosen logging framework for details on creating and configuring log configuration files.

4. **Logging Dependencies**:
   Spring Boot provides default logging configurations, but you might need to add the appropriate logging dependency to your project if you want to use a specific logging framework. For example, if you're using Logback, you can add the following to your `pom.xml` (for Maven):

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <!-- Other dependencies -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
           <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

   Adjust the dependency based on the logging framework you want to use.

Remember that the log levels have an order of precedence: TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR. If you set the log level to `DEBUG`, you'll see log messages of that level and higher (INFO, WARN, ERROR). Adjust the log level according to your debugging needs.

Logging is an essential tool for troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of your application. It's particularly useful for identifying issues, monitoring application flow, and tracking the execution of various components.
