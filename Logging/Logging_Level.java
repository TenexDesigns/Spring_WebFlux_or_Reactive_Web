The appropriate log level for your web API development depends on your specific needs and the level of detail you want to see in your logs. Generally, for web API development, you can consider using the following log levels:

1. **INFO**:
   The `INFO` log level is typically a good starting point for web API development. It provides high-level information about the application's operations, such as requests received, responses sent, and important milestones. It's useful for understanding the overall flow of your application and monitoring its behavior.

2. **WARN**:
   The `WARN` log level is used to highlight potentially problematic situations that are not severe enough to be considered errors. For example, if an API request contains missing or incorrect parameters, you might log a warning message to notify that the request is incomplete or might not behave as expected.

3. **ERROR**:
   The `ERROR` log level is reserved for significant errors that affect the proper functioning of the application. This could include exceptions, failures in critical operations, and other situations where the application cannot proceed normally.

In a development environment, you might start with a lower log level like `DEBUG` to get detailed information for debugging purposes. However, be cautious about using `DEBUG` in a production environment, as it can flood the logs with excessive information and impact performance.

Here's how you can set the log level using the Logback configuration (logback.xml) with the `logback-classic` dependency:

```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5level [%thread] %logger{15} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO"> <!-- Set the desired log level here -->
        <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/>
    </root>
</configuration>
```

In the `<root>` element, you can set the desired log level (e.g., `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR`). Adjust the log pattern and other settings as needed.

Remember that you can adjust the log level based on your development and debugging needs. As your application matures and moves to production, consider keeping the log level at `INFO` or higher to ensure that logs remain informative and focused on important events.
