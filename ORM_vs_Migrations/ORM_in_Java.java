Yes, there are ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solutions that you can use within a Spring WebFlux application to interact with relational databases. While traditional ORM solutions like Hibernate are designed for blocking I/O and may not be suitable for reactive programming, there are reactive ORM options that work well with Spring WebFlux:

1. **Spring Data R2DBC**:
   As mentioned earlier, Spring Data R2DBC is a reactive alternative to Spring Data JPA for working with relational databases using the Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) framework. It allows you to use reactive repositories and reactive queries to interact with your database in a non-blocking manner.

   Spring Data R2DBC supports various relational databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and H2.

2. **jOOQ with jOOQ Reactive**:
   jOOQ is a popular library for generating typesafe SQL queries in Java. jOOQ Reactive is an extension of jOOQ that provides reactive support for querying relational databases in a reactive manner.

   jOOQ Reactive supports reactive data types like `reactor.core.publisher.Flux` and `reactor.core.publisher.Mono`.

3. **Adbatis**:
   Adbatis is a reactive database persistence library inspired by MyBatis. It offers reactive query execution with support for various reactive data types.

   Adbatis is designed to work well with reactive programming models and can be used with Spring WebFlux.

4. **Micronaut Data**:
   While not exclusively an ORM, Micronaut Data is a reactive data access framework that integrates with various data sources, including relational databases. It provides a reactive repository pattern similar to Spring Data's reactive repositories.

   Micronaut Data is designed for reactive programming and can be used with Spring WebFlux applications.

When choosing a reactive ORM for your Spring WebFlux application, consider factors such as the database you're using, the level of integration with your chosen reactive framework, and your familiarity with the library. Spring Data R2DBC is a natural choice if you're already using Spring WebFlux, but you can explore other options if they align better with your requirements.
