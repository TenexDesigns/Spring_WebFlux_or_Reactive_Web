ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and migrations are two distinct concepts that interact with databases in software development:

1. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**:
   ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to work with relational databases using programming objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. The purpose of an ORM is to bridge the gap between the object-oriented programming world and the relational database world.

   With an ORM, you define your data models as classes in your programming language (e.g., Java, C#, Python). The ORM framework handles the mapping between these classes and the corresponding database tables. This mapping enables you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using methods on the object instances, abstracting away the underlying SQL operations.

   Examples of popular ORMs include Hibernate for Java, Entity Framework for .NET, and Django ORM for Python.

2. **Migrations**:
   Database migration is the process of managing changes to a database schema over time. As your application evolves, you might need to add new tables, modify existing columns, or update indexes. Migrations allow you to manage these changes in a structured way.

   Migrations typically involve creating scripts that define the changes you want to make to the database. These scripts are versioned, and the migration tool ensures that the database schema is updated to match the latest version of the application.

   Database migration tools help you apply and manage these scripts, and they often provide features like rollbacks (reverting changes), tracking the current schema version, and ensuring consistency across environments.

   Examples of popular migration tools include Flyway, Liquibase, and Alembic.

In the context of interacting with the database:

- **ORM** focuses on how you interact with data in your application code. It abstracts the complexities of database operations by providing a higher-level programming interface based on objects and relationships.

- **Migrations** focus on how you manage changes to the database schema over time. They ensure that your database schema evolves along with your application's requirements without manual SQL scripting.

Both ORM and migrations play crucial roles in developing and maintaining applications that rely on relational databases. ORM helps you work with data using object-oriented programming principles, while migrations ensure that the database schema stays in sync with your application's changes.
