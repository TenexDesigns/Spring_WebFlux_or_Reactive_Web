It seems like you're observing a difference in the error response when handling exceptions globally versus handling them specifically for a particular case. Let me explain what might be happening:

1. **Specific Exception Handling**: When you handle the `ResourceNotFoundException` specifically for the case where an employee with a given ID is not found, you have control over what response message is returned. In this case, you are returning a custom error message: `"Employee of id " + id + " not found"`. This provides more context to the client about the error.

2. **Global Exception Handling**: When you set up global exception handling, you might have a configuration that converts exceptions into standardized error responses. This configuration might be reducing the error response to a more concise format, which is what you're observing. This is often done to keep error responses consistent across the entire application.

It's important to note that the behavior you're seeing is likely due to how your global exception handler is configured. Global exception handling is useful for handling exceptions consistently across your application, but it might not provide the same level of specific error messaging as when handling exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

To retain more detailed error responses while using global exception handling, you might want to adjust your global exception handling configuration to include more context in the error messages. This might involve accessing the original exception's message and details within your global exception handler and including them in the response.

Remember that the design of error responses in a REST API should strike a balance between providing useful information to clients for debugging purposes and not exposing sensitive information about the application's internals.




Here Is How you can Achies--->roviding useful information to clients for debugging purposes and not exposing sensitive information about the application's internals
------------------



Certainly! To achieve this, you can customize your global exception handler to include more details from the original exception while maintaining a balance between informative error messages and security. Here's an example using Spring Boot's `@ControllerAdvice`:

```java
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest;

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(404, ex.getMessage(), null); // Set path to null
        return ResponseEntity.status(404).body(errorResponse);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleGlobalException(Exception ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value(), "An internal server error occurred", request.getDescription(false));
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
```

In the above example, we're assuming you have an `ErrorResponse` class that holds the details of the error response:

```java
public class ErrorResponse {
    private int status;
    private String message;
    private String path;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
```

For the specific `ResourceNotFoundException`, we're creating an instance of `ErrorResponse` and populating it with the relevant information, such as the HTTP status code, the exception message, and the request description. This provides enough information for the client to understand what went wrong without revealing too much about the application's internals.

For other general exceptions, such as `Exception.class`, we're handling them with a more generic error response. This helps ensure that even unexpected errors are handled gracefully.

Remember that this example is a basic demonstration of how you can customize error responses in a global exception handler. You can further enhance and customize the error response structure, messages, and handling based on your application's needs.





The Erros will look like this if we make the above modifications
// This is as a result of trying to delete a non -exixting  emplouee of Id 555
//This erro resoinse is of format from ErroResponse class but  This Message is Give bt GlobalHandler

{
    "status": 404,
    "message": "Anime with ID 50 not found",
    "path": null
}






1_Thows erro if id doe not exist

  public Mono<Anime> findById(int id) {
        return animeRepository.findById(id)
                .switchIfEmpty(Mono.error(new ResourceNotFoundException("Anime with ID " + id + " not found")));
    }
            //How do I trwo error in spring boot , in what scenarios do I throw errors and how , using what













2_ResourceNotFoundException class

This receives an erro mesages

@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class ResourceNotFoundException extends RuntimeException{

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public ResourceNotFoundException(String message){
        super(message);
    }
}



3_ErrorResponse class
This takes in the error message, status code and  path 

public class ErrorResponse {
    private int status;
    private String message;
    private String path;

    public ErrorResponse(int status, String message,  String path) {
        this.status = status;
        this.message = message;
        this.path = path;
    }

// Getter and seteer methods 





4.GlobalExceptionHandler 

This responseds with th erro resposne giving back the meeage, sttus code and  path used


@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(404, ex.getMessage(), null); // Set path to null
        return ResponseEntity.status(404).body(errorResponse);
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleGlobalException(Exception ex, WebRequest request) {
        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value(), "An internal server error occurred", request.getDescription(false));
        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
    }
}
