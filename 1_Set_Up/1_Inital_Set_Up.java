To start developing an application using Spring WebFlux, you can follow these steps to set up your project and add the necessary dependencies:

1. **Create a New Project**:
   You can create a new Spring WebFlux project using Spring Initializr. Visit the [Spring Initializr website](https://start.spring.io/) and configure your project with the following options:
   - Select your preferred programming language (Java or Kotlin).
   - Choose the Spring Boot version.
   - Select the "Reactive Web" dependency.

2. **Add Additional Dependencies**:
   Depending on your application's requirements, you might need to add additional dependencies. Common dependencies include:
   - Spring Data (e.g., Reactive MongoDBB, Spring Data R2DBC:) if you're working with databases using webflux.
   - Spring Security if you need security features.
   - Any other dependencies for specific functionalities.

3. **Build and Run the Application**:
   After generating the project, you can import it into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
   - Open the main application class (usually named `YourApplicationNameApplication`) and run it. This starts the embedded server and your Spring WebFlux application.

4. **Create Controllers and Routes**:
   Start by creating controllers that define the routes and endpoints for your application. Use annotations like `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping` to map HTTP requests to methods.

5. **Define Reactive Endpoints**:
   When working with Spring WebFlux, you can use reactive programming constructs such as `Flux` and `Mono` to handle asynchronous data streams. These constructs allow you to work with reactive data sources and provide non-blocking responses.

6. **Run and Test Endpoints**:
   With your controllers and routes defined, you can run your application and test the endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or a web browser.

Here's a basic example of a Spring WebFlux application setup:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@SpringBootApplication
public class WebFluxDemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WebFluxDemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@RestController
class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public Flux<User> getUsers() {
        // Simulate fetching users asynchronously
        return Flux.just(new User("Alice"), new User("Bob"));
    }
}

class User {
    private String name;

    public User(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `UserController` defines an endpoint that returns a `Flux` of `User` objects asynchronously. The `WebFluxDemoApplication` class is the entry point for the application.

Remember to explore Spring WebFlux documentation, experiment with reactive programming constructs, and adapt your application based on your project's requirements.
